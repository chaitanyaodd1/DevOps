GIT & Github
::::::::::::

Version Control: Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing 
'''''''''''''''	 changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software 
		 teams manage changes to source code over time.

Repository: A Centralised storage for managing and tracking changes to the collection of the files and
	    directories.

			Developer push the code to a repository
					||
			code will be deployed from the repository

	•) now if someone wants the code he/she will have to fetch the code from Repository
						||
					      modify
						||
					Push back to repository

•) Types of version Control system

1. Centralised							2. Distributed

•)Workspace- Area where the Developer is working and creating/modifying code.
•)Inex/staging area - Area that closely mimics the local repo.
•)local repo - the local area for all the local code.
•)remote repo- the remote area {GitHub} for all the code.	

Git Workflow -1

• git init: Git will create "Workspace"
** never do "git init" in a sub-dir of directory where "git init" is already initialised
• git add file1: Add the to  the "Staging area"
• git commit:
• git push: the changes will go to the "Remote Repository"

Git CMDS
''''''''
• git clone
• git init
• git add
• git commit -m "message"
• git config --global user.name "username"
• git config --global user.email "email@user"
• git branch -M main
• git remote add origin (repo URl)
• git push -u origin main

Docker and Containerization
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Container technology: It refers to a lightweight, executable unit of software that packages up 
		      application code and its dependencies.
Containerization:Containerization refers to the process of packaging software code along with 
		 its necessary dependencies (such as operating system libraries) into a single 
		 lightweight executable unit called a container.

~~~Image and Conatiner
   ```````````````````
•)Build: Create an image.
•)Run: run the image as a conatiner.

⁂ DOCKER
'''''''''
• Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build,
  deploy, run, update, and manage standardized, executable components
  called containers. These containers combine application source code 
  with the necessary operating system libraries and dependencies 
  required to run that code in any environment.
